# ReZ Classic
rez is a celeste-like game where you play as a ghost trying to get back home. this is the unfinished classic 5.0 version of rez that features many missing features. a full game is being developed by my friends nova and surson.

this version of the game is mainly for modding in qol features, making new campaigns with custom music, adding new tech, or new mechanics entirely.

all the game versions are avaiable here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1teW5lsqJpuKxWLVOMh7M3S5fIgHqTmdX
